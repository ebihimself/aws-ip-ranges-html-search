# AWS IP Prefixes Search Page

This repository hosts a simple, user-friendly search interface for Amazon Web Services (AWS) IP prefixes. This HTML interface makes it easier to search for AWS IP address ranges by region and service. The raw JSON data is fetched from AWS's official source [here](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json). You can access the live site [here](https://ebrahimahmadi.github.io/aws-ip-ranges-html-search/).

## Use Cases

This search interface can be useful in a number of situations:

1. **Security:** Security administrators can use this page to quickly find the IP ranges associated with specific AWS services or regions. This can help with setting up firewall rules that only allow traffic from trusted AWS services.

2. **Network Configuration:** If a company uses AWS and wants to ensure that its internal systems only accept traffic from AWS, they can use this interface to find the appropriate IP ranges.

3. **Traffic Analysis:** Network analysts can use this page to identify network traffic associated with AWS services.

4. **Troubleshooting:** Developers and system administrators can use this page to investigate whether changes in AWS IP ranges have impacted application behavior.
